Hi, Iâ€™m @RavelLarose! I work with both Python and Java, as well as some work in R and HTML as well. 

I've worked with sentiment analysis before, and have experience cleaning data and data analysis in Python, Java and R. 
You can find a previous project of mine at http://ravellarose.pythonanywhere.com/
Other projects can also be found on this github.

Reach me at ravel.larose.work@gmail.com if you'd like to discuss work opportunites, project ideas, or other related topics!
