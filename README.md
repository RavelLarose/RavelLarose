Hi, Iâ€™m @RavelLarose! I work with both Python and Java, as well as some work in R and HTML as well. 

I've worked with sentiment analysis before, and have experience cleaning data and data analysis in Python. 
You can find a previous project of mine at http://ravellarose.pythonanywhere.com/, or the source code (including the data cleaning in Java, the analysis in Python, and the app creation in Flask with HTML) on this github.
Other projects can also be found here. 

Reach me at ravel.larose.work@gmail.com if you'd like to discuss work opportunites, project ideas, or other related topics!
