A sentiment analysis project based on scraped Tweets containing the hashtag #B99, as well as the first
four seasons of the show Brooklyn99. Data was analyzed to detect the most popular and most controversial
characters, the characters who had the most positive sentiment in the show and how this effected their 
popularity on Twitter, and other points of interest, such as the most commonly used positive or negative
words on Twitter and in the show. Completed in partner with Alen Kupperan.
