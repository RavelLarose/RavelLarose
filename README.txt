A research paper I completed in my senior year of my Bachelor's of Science in 
Chemistry at the University of Connecticut. The paper focused on the detrimental 
effects of microplastic accumulation on many different species of ocean life from
various published and peer-reviewed sources and concluded a potential safety limit
that would pose the least severe and long lasting risk to the health of the world's
oceans as a whole.
